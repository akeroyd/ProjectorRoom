# ProjectorRoom

This is a THREE js Demo, built for a hackathon.

[View the Demo](https://akeroyd.github.io/ProjectorRoom/)

The ideas is that you could surround a meeting room with cheap cameras (e.g. ESP32 cam), project all the camera feeds onto 3d geometry of the room.

This would make all fixes surfaces render somewhat accurately (e.g. kanban walls, whiteboards, documents on the table, etc), but movable items and people in the room would appear distorted.
This distortion can be reduced by highlighting the projector closest to the view-camera.

## TypeScript (v2)

```bash
npm run dev
```
